# Overview of the report

To find out who were most affected by the COVID-19 situation in Toronto. I downloaded all of the COVID-19 case reports from City of Toronto's data portal and run some analysis on them. Result shows that COVID-19 is much more fatal if the patient is old. And COVID-19 spreas much faster in neighborhood with low-income or high population density.
